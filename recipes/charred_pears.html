    <h1>Charred Spiced Pears with Smoky Vanilla-Cherry Sauce</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Toasted vanilla meets torched ripe pears in these charred spiced pears with smoky vanilla-cherry sauce, a subtly sweet finisher. Use a vanilla bean that’s moist and pliable—if it’s too dry, it will ignite when you torch it. Use pears at peak ripeness; the juices will help the brown sugar adhere.

    <p><strong>Prep Time:</strong> 15 minutes</p>
    <p><strong>Cook Time:</strong> 30 minutes</p>
    <p><strong>Servings:</strong> 8</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 vanilla bean</li>
        <li>1/2 cup brandy</li>
        <li>10 ounces frozen tart red cherries, thawed</li>
        <li>1/2 cup packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground allspice</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons cornstarch</li>
        <li>4 ripe pears, halved lengthwise and cored</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Put vanilla bean on a foil-lined baking sheet set on a wire rack. Toast vanilla bean with a kitchen torch, turning occasionally, until lightly charred and starting to smoke, about 30 seconds. Let cool 5 minutes. Split vanilla bean lengthwise.</li>
        <li>Combine split vanilla bean and brandy in a medium saucepan. Carefully bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium; cook, stirring occasionally, until brandy is reduced to 2 tablespoons, 7 to 8 minutes. Meanwhile, blend cherries in a blender or food processor until smooth.</li>
        <li>Stir together brown sugar, ginger, allspice, and pepper in a shallow bowl. For sauce, add 3 tablespoons brown sugar mixture, the puréed cherries, and salt to brandy mixture in saucepan. Return to a boil; reduce heat to medium and simmer, stirring occasionally, until sugar is dissolved, about 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove vanilla bean from sauce; scrape out seeds. Stir seeds into sauce, then strain through a fine-mesh sieve. Return sauce to saucepan.</li>
        <li>Whisk together water and cornstarch. Add to sauce. Bring to a boil over medium heat; reduce heat to medium-low. Cook, stirring constantly, until thickened, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Dip cut sides of pears in remaining brown sugar mixture to coat evenly. Arrange pears, cut sides up, on prepared baking sheet. Brown sugared surface of pears with a kitchen torch, about 5 minutes for entire recipe. Serve pears with sauce. (Chill sauce in an airtight container up to 5 days.)</li>

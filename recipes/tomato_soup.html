        <li>4 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>1 large slice of onion</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons white sugar, or to taste</li>

        <li>Gradually whisk in a bit of the tomato mixture to prevent lumps from forming, then stir in the rest.</li>
